I've just bought my TouchSmart, and this is my feedback.  
It came with: two manuals ( HP &amp; Vista , A Remote Control , A Pen , 2 batteries (one 4 cell , and the other 8 cell), a tissue to clean the screen , which gets dirty with my fingerprints :D, a small bag , very bad bag , it doesn't have any handle to carry from :s , it fits only from keeping dust away from the tablet.

However, the most annoying thing is that It have 32-Bit Vista Installed ( on a 64 Bit Machine)!!
<p>With too much pre-Installed demos and toolbars , I hate those advertisements</p>
<p>(but there is cool games free for forst time only :p )</p>
<p>and there is a  note (with very small font) on the box , saying that if you want to take full advantage of your AMD Turion processor , you have to buy Vista 64 Bit&#160;!!</p>
<p>But , thanks Mansoura University which offers free Vista for it&#8217;s Students :flirt:</p>
<p>problems I&#8217;ve faced till now&#160;: Hardware problem with keyboard</p>
<p>while switching to/from Tablet/Laptop mode , sometimes keyboard doesn&#8217;t work at all&#160;!</p>
<p>it&#8217;s solution was HARD RESET , which is&#160;: Switch off the Notebook , Remove battery and power cord if conencted</p>
<p>then press and hold the Power Switch for full 30 seconds</p>
<p>Edit: HP has solved this problem and made WinFlash Utility to solve this problem ( <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=ob-68739-1&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;product=3877319&amp;os=2100&amp;lang=en">Here</a> )</p>
<p>another annoying thing , no CDs/DVDs came with the notebook , only a paper saying that if you want recover DVD , you have to burn your own :s</p>
<p>actually there is a Recovery partition to Recover without DVDs , but it is more safe to have your Restore on DVDs.</p>
