<p>JDownloader &#8230; One of the best Download Manager I&#8217;ve Ever used</p>
<p>It makes rapidshare much easier ( and megaupload too )</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take the links in a single line inputbox, but in a BIG multiline textarea</p>

<p>each link in a line &#8230; OK&#160;? it matches the links and get the common part , this will the Folder&#8217;s name ;)</p>
<p>and add the files to it&#8217;s downloading queue , and begin downloading .. SMARTLY</p>
<p>after the first file downloads .. it wait the 15 minutes between each file , then start the next file</p>
<p>.. and you can give the program your router&#8217;s username and password , so when you reach rapidshare&#8217;s limit it automatically reset your connection , to renew your IP , then continue downloading&#160;!!!!</p>
<p>In case you are downloading RARed Parts with password , you can type the password, so the program will automatically extract the files after it finishes the download&#160;!</p>
<p>Begad &#8230; WOW</p>
