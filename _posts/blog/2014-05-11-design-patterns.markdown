![Head first Design patterns](/blog/images/my-head-first-design-patterns.jpg "My copy of Head First design patterns")

While I was cleaning my office,
I found my copy of "Head First Design Patterns" book under a pile of dust.
One of the first books that helped to write better code.

However, Since I finished this book a lot of stuff changed,
I stopped using Java and switched to Python for couple of years,
until I came back to the JVM, but using Scala this time.
I really loved Scala,
I can write beautiful code while having reasonable performance.

So I decided to revise the book, trying to apply what I've learned so far.
