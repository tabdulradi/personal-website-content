title: Solution of Windows 7 taskbar Problem with Java Applications

Well , did any one have the problem I got in Windows 7? I can't pin JDownloader to my taskbar.
If I opened it and right-clicked the icon on taskbar and choosed Pin to task bar "javaw" program is pinned instead.

<p>and if I right-clicked it&#8217;s icon from start menu and choosed pin to taskbar .. I get the correct icon pinned in taskbar .. but when I click it &#8230; it opens a new icon in the taskbar!</p>
<p>Well this problem because JDownloader is a java application and is running from javaw process &#8230; although there is a way to make your java application have it&#8217;s unique process &#8230; but JDownloader team decided not to use it</p>
<p>A Solution I found for this problem &#8230; Which worked with JDownloader .. and should work with any Java application facing same problem&#160;:</p>
<p>Browse to your Java directory in Program Files &#8230; Make a Copy of &#8216;javaw.exe&#8217; file &#8230; and rename it to the Programs name &#8230; ( in this case I renamed it to &#8220;JDownloader.exe&#8221; )</p>
<p>then create a new shortcut to the new file, plus a parameter .. which will be your Program&#8217;s JAR file location</p>
<p>&#8220;C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\JDownloader.exe&#8221; -Xmx512m -jar &#8220;[J-Downloader&#8217;s Path]\JDownloader.jar&#8221;</p>
<p>you may want to Right-Click the Icon .. and from it&#8217;s properties Choose &#8220;Change Icon&#8221; and choose your program&#8217;s icon .. ( instead of Java&#8217;s icon)</p>
<p>Now .. Right Click your Shorcut and Choose Pin to taskbar &#8230; Now you should have your program&#8217;s Icon in the taskbar &#8230; and if you opened it .. it won&#8217;t duplicate</p>
<p>note&#160;: firewall won&#8217;t recognize the &#8220;new&#8221; JDownloader &#8230; you should re-allow it . in it&#8217;s new shape</p>
<p>that&#8217;s all folks .</p>
